# Number-Guessing-Game
    * The game where user needs to guess the number between any given range
    * The timer starts as soon as the range is decided & remaining time is shown after every try

    2. User can give a range they need to guess the number from
    3. Display the time remaining to guess the value
    4. When user guesses a number, display whether it's "Too High" or "Too Low" comparatively
    5. When the guessing is done if the number hasn't been guessed then reveal the correct number
